## Documentation

For EPRI developers, see the guides documentation in https://gitlab.epri.com/gat-devs/guides/-/blob/master/tool-guides/GRIDOPT.md.

Version 1.3.6 documentation for this library can be found online `http://pfnet-python.readthedocs.io`.
But, it is preferred that you build the documentation using Sphinx (prerequisite) by going to the docs folder. Then run `make html` to build html documentation (for example).
